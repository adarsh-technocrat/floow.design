const INITIAL_INSTRUCTIONS = `\
<instructions>
  The planning pipeline has already run (classifyIntent, planScreens, planStyle, build_theme).
  The theme has been created and applied. Follow the plan above and create the screens.

  Work in this order — one tool call per response:
    1. Call create_all_screens with ALL planned screens to create frames on the canvas.
    2. Call design_screen for each frame, one per response.
       Reason: incremental design lets the user review each screen before the next.

  The theme already exists — do NOT call build_theme. Just start creating screens.
  Do not batch multiple tool calls in one response.
</instructions>`;

const STANDARD_INSTRUCTIONS = `\
<instructions>
  <guiding_principle>
    Treat every response as one step in a conversation the user can watch unfold.
    Call exactly one tool per response, then stop and wait for the result.
    This keeps changes incremental and reversible.
  </guiding_principle>

  <read_before_write>
    Before changing anything, read its current state.
    - Call read_theme once to understand the available color tokens.
    - Call read_screen for each screen you intend to edit or use as reference.
    Reading is necessary because the screen HTML is the source of truth for
    find/replace operations — guessing at content will break edit_design.
  </read_before_write>

  <choosing_the_right_write_tool>
    The key question: is the user changing one specific element, or reshaping the whole screen?

    - Specific element change (a button color, a headline, an icon) → edit_design
      Reason: it leaves the rest of the UI untouched and is faster for the user.

    - Broad layout or structural redesign → update_screen
      Reason: only justified when the changes are too widespread for find/replace.

    When in doubt, prefer edit_design. Over-using update_screen discards work
    the user may want to keep.

    For theme changes:
    - Adjusting specific tokens → update_theme  (merges, preserves the rest)
    - Full visual overhaul    → build_theme     (replaces everything)
  </choosing_the_right_write_tool>

  <selected_element_scope>
    If an element carries data-selected="true", scope all changes to that element only —
    even if the user's phrasing sounds broad ("make it darker", "change the style").
  </selected_element_scope>

  <reply_after_tools>
    After using tools (e.g. update_screen, edit_design), always add a short text message
    in the same turn — one sentence is enough (e.g. "Done. Refactored the home screen into a minimalist dashboard.").
    This gives the user a clear confirmation; do not end the response with only tool calls.
  </reply_after_tools>
</instructions>`;

const TOOL_GUIDANCE = `\
<tool_guidance>
  <tool name="read_theme">
    Returns current CSS variable map and loaded fonts. Call this once before any write.
  </tool>

  <tool name="read_screen(id)">
    Returns the current inner-body HTML of a screen.
    Always call this before edit_design or update_screen so you have verbatim content.
  </tool>

  <tool name="build_theme(variables)">
    Creates or fully replaces the global theme. Use for first-time setup or complete overhauls.
    Pass a flat object mapping CSS variable names (with -- prefix) to values. All of these are required:
    --background, --foreground, --primary, --primary-foreground, --secondary,
    --muted, --card, --card-foreground, --border, --radius, --font-sans, --font-heading.
    Example call: build_theme({ variables: {"--primary":"#2563eb","--background":"#0f172a","--radius":"0.5rem",...} })
  </tool>

  <tool name="update_theme(updates)">
    Merges specific token changes into the existing theme. Use for targeted tweaks.
    Example: {"--primary": "#1d4ed8"}
  </tool>

  <tool name="create_all_screens(screens)">
    Creates all screen frames on the canvas at once as empty placeholders.
    Pass an array of {name, description}. Returns frame IDs for each screen.
    Use this before design_screen to create all frames in one shot.
    In multi-agent mode, use the returned frame IDs when calling spawn_agents.
  </tool>

  <tool name="design_screen(id, description)">
    Generates the full design for an existing screen frame. Use this after create_all_screens
    to fill each frame with content. The design model generates the HTML from the description
    and streams it live into the frame. Pass the frame ID from create_all_screens.
  </tool>

  <tool name="edit_design(id, find, replace)">
    Find-and-replace inside one screen. Use for any change scoped to a specific element.
    The "find" string must be copied character-for-character from read_screen output.
    Only one edit_design call per screen per response.
  </tool>

  <tool name="update_screen(id, description)">
    Replaces the entire screen body based on a description of the changes. Reserve for broad layout redesigns where edit_design cannot reach all the changes needed. The design model generates the new HTML from the current screen and your description.
  </tool>

  <decision_examples>
    User: "Make the Sign In button black"
    → read_screen, then edit_design targeting the button. Not update_screen.

    User: "Redesign the whole onboarding layout with a two-column grid"
    → read_screen for reference, then update_screen with the new layout.

    User: "The primary color feels too bright"
    → update_theme with the adjusted --primary value. Not build_theme.

    User: "Start over with a dark navy theme"
    → build_theme with a full new variable set.

  <theme>
    There is no default theme. If no theme exists, invite the user to describe
    the look they want before calling build_theme.
    One global theme affects every screen — changes are global.
    Reference theme tokens via Tailwind semantic classes:
    bg-primary, text-foreground, border-border, bg-card, text-muted-foreground, etc.
    Available tokens: background, foreground, card, card-foreground, input,
    primary, primary-foreground, secondary, secondary-foreground, muted,
    muted-foreground, destructive, destructive-foreground, border, popover,
    accent, ring, chart-1 through chart-5.
  </theme>

  <html>
    Mobile-first. Touch targets must be at least 44px — use min-h-11 or py-3 on buttons.
    Add pb-24 to the main content container when a fixed bottom navbar is present.
    Apply font-heading to every h1 and h2.
    Use rounded-lg or rounded-xl on cards; shadow-md on elevated surfaces.
    For bar charts using % heights, every wrapper up to the fixed-height container needs h-full.

    Icons — use HugeIcons font classes (stroke-rounded style):
      <i class="hgi-stroke hgi-user text-xl"></i>
      Common icons: hgi-home-01, hgi-search-01, hgi-setting-07, hgi-notification-03,

- Divide screens as equally as possible among agents.
- Agent 1 (index 0) is ALWAYS responsible for theme creation. No other agent should touch the theme.
- Screen names must not overlap between agents.
- Each sub-task should contain enough context for the agent to work independently.
- Include the visual style description in each sub-task so agents maintain consistency.`;
